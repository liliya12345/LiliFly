 Lilifly Music Application
The Lilifly music application was developed as an Android native application using Kotlin, integrating multiple APIs and services to create a comprehensive music streaming experience.

Technical Architecture
The application follows a multi-fragment architecture with a single Activity (MainActivity) managing navigation between different feature sections: PopularFragment for artist discovery, AlbumFragment for album browsing, TopFragment for track listings, and UserFragment for favorites management. The DataModel ViewModel serves as the central data repository, maintaining application state across configuration changes.

Key Integrations
The application successfully integrates several critical services:

Spotify API: Implements both App Remote SDK for playback control and Web API for music data retrieval

Firebase Authentication: Google Sign-In implementation using Credential Manager API

Firebase Realtime Database: Cloud persistence for user favorites synchronization

Volley: HTTP client for REST API communications with Spotify services

Technical Challenges Solved
The implementation addressed several complex challenges:

OAuth 2.0 token management with automatic refresh handling

Real-time synchronization between local favorites and cloud storage

Background music playback with Spotify App Remote connectivity

Notification system with runtime permission handling for Android 13+

Responsive UI adapting to both portrait and landscape orientations

Code Quality Features
The codebase demonstrates good practices including:

ViewModel architecture for lifecycle-aware data management

Proper error handling and logging throughout the API calls

Modular design with separate adapters for different view types

Resource management with Glide for image loading

Navigation component implementation for fragment transactions

The application successfully delivers a seamless music discovery and playback experience while maintaining robust error handling and responsive user interactions across different device configurations.
